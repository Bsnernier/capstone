Gamer Gazer is an app for video game hobbyists to review games and keep track of their games from different platforms. The User can leave a review for others to use or add games to their library and keep track of completion status. Reviews are used by other users to judge whether a game is worth playing or not, and the library is used to keep track of all the user's games no matter what platform they are on and keep track of their progress.
